# Intro-to-DS
The Introduction to Datascience course tells us about CRISP-DM process and how to apply it to many Data science problems.

CRISP-DM states 6 steps:

1. Business understanding – What does the business need?
2. Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
3. Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
4. Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
5. Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
6. Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?
